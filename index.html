            <p>Combining two signature Seattle icons: a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies.
                <br>
                These cookies made into the shape of a salmon that has just a hint of fishy goodness.
                <br><br>
                Salmon Cookies, soon with franchises internationally, calculate the number of cookies each location must
                make every day
                so that it can manage its supplies inventory and baking schedule.
                <br><br>
                The number of cookies to make depends on the hours of operation (6:00 AM to 8:00 PM for all locations)
                and a few factors unique to each location:
                <br>
                <br>The minimum number of customers per hour.
                <br>The maximum number of customers per hour.
                <br>The average number of cookies purchased per customer.
